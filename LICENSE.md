All files are based on this license, but in some source code there is
additional info about exception resulting from hardware - most of code is
designed for Microchip PIC's and dsPIC's - so most of source code files will
work only on Microchip platform. If you want to change platform, you should
change some code, beacuse of architecture and available features for each
microcontroller family.
